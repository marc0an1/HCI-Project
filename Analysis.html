                <h2>Data Collection & Analysis</h2>
                <p>To evaluate the design of our Swiftbat Airlines website, we conducted a structured survey targeting classmates who were
                not part of our design group. We formulated the questionnaire using a combination of the provided questions and
                additional items derived from HCI/Interaction Design research. The survey included Likert-scale questions to measure
                user experience, ease of use, and overall satisfaction, as well as open-ended questions for qualitative feedback. The
                survey was distributed online using Google Forms, ensuring accessibility and ease of response collection. Respondents
                provided insights based on their interactions with the website prototype, and we gathered sufficient data to perform a
                meaningful analysis.</p>
                <p>Once the data was collected, we exported the results to a spreadsheet for statistical analysis. We calculated the mean,
                median, and mode for each Likert-scale question to determine the central tendency of user feedback. Visualizations,
                including line graphs, were created to represent the distribution of responses. Additionally, we analyzed qualitative
                feedback to extract common themes and identify areas for improvement, such as usability challenges or aesthetic
                preferences.</p>
                <p>Our analysis revealed that most respondents found the Swiftbat Airlines website intuitive and visually appealing, with a
                high mean score for usability and interactivity. However, a subset of users suggested improvements in the navigation
                structure, indicating room for enhancement in this area. These results, along with the statistical charts and
                qualitative insights, were integrated into a dedicated results tab on our website, ensuring transparency and
                accessibility. The findings guided us in refining the website design to better align with user expectations and improve
                overall satisfaction.</p>
